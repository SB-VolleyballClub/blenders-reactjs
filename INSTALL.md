brew install npm

## Adding Redux
Used the following as a guide:
* https://code.likeagirl.io/tutorial-for-adding-redux-to-a-react-app-1a94cc1738e5

```
git checkout -b addRedux  # create new branch
npm add redux
npm add react-redux
npm add redux-thunk
```

## Coming in to a new install on a system with npm and node already installed
Need to update npm and node
```
sudo npm cache clean -f
sudo npm install -g n
sudo n stable

npm install    # Installs modules per package.json
```
